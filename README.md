# STAG_Tools
Python tools which expand the capability of ArcGIS Desktop

These tools were created to help users more effectively perform both simple and complex tasks in ArcGIS for Desktop.
They are all written in native Python leveraging the ArcPy module.

Note that a conscious decision was made to write these tools as procedural code, and not object-oriented code.  This enables
non-programmers to open the source code behind each tool and understand what is happening throughout the script.  In this
way analysts and users can copy/paste the code into their own tools, or simply expand on the code provided.
